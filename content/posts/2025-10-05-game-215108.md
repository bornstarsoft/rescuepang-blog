As the gaming community eagerly anticipates the results of the 43rd annual Golden Joystick Awards, two standout titles from Nintendo's Switch 2 lineup, *Mario Kart World* and *Donkey Kong Bananza*, have made a significant impact by being shortlisted for the prestigious 'Console Game of the Year' award. This recognition not only highlights the quality of these games but also underscores the Switch 2's growing library of acclaimed titles since its launch.

In addition to vying for the top honor, *Mario Kart World* is also nominated for 'Best Multiplayer Game', while *Donkey Kong Bananza* competes for 'Best Audio Design'. With stiff competition from other major titles like *Death Stranding 2* and *Ghost of Ytei*, the stakes are high, and fans are excited to see how these beloved franchises fare in the awards.

Voting is currently open across 21 categories, allowing gamers to support their favorite titles until the end of the month. As we look forward to the announcement of the winners on November 20th, one can't help but wonder: will Nintendo continue to dominate the gaming landscape with its innovative offerings?
