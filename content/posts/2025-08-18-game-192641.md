In a bold move to address the pressing issue of gender pay inequality, Mavens has introduced The Balancing Act, a puzzle game designed to engage players in the realities of Australias 21.8% gender pay gap. This innovative training tool not only entertains but also educates participants about the frustrations faced by women in the workforce, making it a significant addition to workplace training programs.

The game, created by a talented team including Leah Morris, Feryx Lim, and Evelyn Tran, involves removing 22 pieces from a 500-piece jigsaw puzzle to symbolize the gender pay gap. As players attempt to complete the puzzle, they experience firsthand the imbalance and confusion that many women encounter daily in their careers. This creative approach aims to spark conversations and drive advocacy for meaningful change in workplace equality.

With supporting materials that clarify the difference between equal pay and the gender pay gap, The Balancing Act serves as a reminder that while progress has been made, there is still much work to be done. How can we leverage creative solutions like this to foster a more equitable workplace for everyone?
