In a significant legal victory, Nintendo has secured a $2 million settlement against Ryan Daly, a Michigan-based seller of modded Switch consoles. This case underscores the ongoing battle between gaming companies and those who facilitate piracy through unauthorized modifications. Daly, who previously denied any wrongdoing, has now agreed to a permanent injunction that bars him from handling or promoting modded hardware in the future.

Nintendo's lawsuit, filed in July 2024, accused Daly of selling modded consoles and offering services to install pirated games, including popular titles like Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda. This settlement not only highlights the company's commitment to protecting its intellectual property but also serves as a warning to others in the modding community. As the gaming landscape evolves, how will companies continue to adapt their strategies against piracy?
