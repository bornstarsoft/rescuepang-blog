In a bold move that has caught the attention of gamers worldwide, indie developer Pixel Maniacs has announced their upcoming puzzler, *ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard*, claiming it as a sequel to *Portal 2* that Valve never made. This audacious comparison sets high expectations, especially given the legacy of *Portal 2* as one of the most beloved puzzle games in history. The developers are clearly confident, and the excitement is palpable as they invite players to experience their unique take on the genre.

While the game draws visual inspiration from the *Portal* series, the gameplay mechanics seem to lean more towards titles like *Qube* and *Qube 2*. Players will utilize a colorful gun to manipulate objects and solve puzzles, which adds a fresh twist to the puzzle-solving experience. The free demo available on Steam allows players to dive into this vibrant world and see for themselves how it stacks up against its predecessors.

With the original *ChromaGun* earning 'Mostly Positive' reviews since its release in 2016, the sequel has the potential to carve out its own niche in the puzzle game landscape. As the gaming community eagerly anticipates its launch, one can't help but wonder: will *ChromaGun 2* redefine indie puzzle games, or will it merely echo the greatness of its inspirations?
