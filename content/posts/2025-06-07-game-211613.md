Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has officially announced the title of its highly anticipated game, previously known as Project Century. Dubbed **Stranger Than Heaven**, this new title is set against the intriguing backdrop of Japan in 1915, promising a unique narrative experience that could redefine expectations for the studio known for its iconic Like a Dragon and Yakuza series.

While details remain scarce, the announcement made during the Summer Game Fest has sparked excitement among fans and gamers alike. The game was first teased at The Game Awards in December 2024, but itâ€™s still unclear whether Stranger Than Heaven will be a new entry in the beloved Yakuza franchise or an entirely standalone experience. This ambiguity adds to the intrigue, as Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is also busy working on the next installment of the Virtua Fighter series.

As we await further information, the gaming community is left to ponder what innovative gameplay and storytelling elements Stranger Than Heaven will bring to the table. Will it live up to the legacy of its predecessors, or carve out its own distinct path? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure: the anticipation is palpable.
