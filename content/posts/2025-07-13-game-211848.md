Indie horror game Haus Of Irndrous is currently available for free on Steam, but this opportunity is fleeting. Players have until July 19 to claim this atmospheric puzzle game, which will transition to a paid model at a price of $1.99. This shift marks a significant moment for the game, which has garnered attention since its early access launch in August 2024.

Developed by Yxtopia Studios, Haus Of Irndrous has been designed as an episodic experience, with the first chapter intended to remain free while future episodes would be paid content. However, the decision to charge for the game now reflects the studio's need for funding to support ongoing development and server maintenance. This change is not uncommon in the gaming industry, as seen with other titles that have made similar transitions.

As the game evolves, Yxtopia Studios aims to gather player feedback to refine future content. The recent update has introduced improvements in enemy AI and performance, hinting at exciting developments on the horizon. Will you take advantage of this limited-time offer and dive into the chilling world of Haus Of Irndrous before it becomes a paid title?
