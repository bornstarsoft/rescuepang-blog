If you're a fan of puzzle games but often find them too challenging, then Botany Manor might just be the perfect fit for you. Currently available for free on the Epic Games Store, this cozy first-person puzzle game invites players to step into the shoes of botanist Arabella Greene as she explores a Victorian manor to complete her botanical research book. Unlike other puzzle games that can leave you feeling frustrated, Botany Manor strikes a balance between engaging challenges and a relaxing atmosphere.

The developers have clearly put a lot of thought into creating a game that caters to casual gamers. Lead developer Laure De May emphasized that the puzzles are designed to be intriguing without being overly taxing, making it accessible for players who might not have the time or energy for more demanding titles like The Witness or Blue Prince. With positive reviews highlighting its appeal to cozy gamers, Botany Manor is definitely worth checking out, especially since this is its first time being offered for free.

As we look forward to more engaging titles like Botany Manor, it raises the question: how can developers continue to innovate in the puzzle genre while keeping accessibility in mind? Let's hope for more games that prioritize enjoyment over frustration.
