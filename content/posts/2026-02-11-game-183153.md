Apple has just announced an exciting lineup of games coming to Apple Arcade in March, with the highlight being the release of "Oceanhorn 3: Legend of the Shadow Sea". Launching on March 5, this new chapter in the beloved action-RPG-adventure franchise invites both longtime fans and newcomers to explore a vibrant world filled with lost islands, titans, and mysteries waiting to be uncovered. With its stunning 3D graphics, players can enjoy this immersive experience across multiple Apple devices, including iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and the innovative Apple Vision Pro.

In addition to Oceanhorn 3, Apple Arcade will also welcome three other games: "Pocket Love!+", a charming life simulator; "Flow Free+", a challenging puzzle game; and "Doraemon Dorayaki Shop Story+", a delightful shop management game featuring the iconic manga character. All these titles will be available on the same day, promising a diverse gaming experience for subscribers.

As Apple Arcade continues to expand its library, it raises the question: what other beloved franchises might make their way to this all-you-can-play service in the future? With the platform's commitment to delivering high-quality gaming experiences, the possibilities are endless.
