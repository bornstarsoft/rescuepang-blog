Square Enix has officially revealed that Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade will be the largest game on the Nintendo Switch 2, with a staggering file size of up to 99GB. This means that installing the game could consume nearly 40% of the console's base storage, which is a significant consideration for gamers looking to maximize their library on the new platform.

In comparison, other AAA titles on the Switch 2, such as Hogwarts Legacy and Cyberpunk 2077, have managed to keep their file sizes much lower, ranging from 23GB to 62GB. The sheer size of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade raises questions about storage management and the potential need for expanded memory solutions for players eager to dive into this epic RPG.

As we look forward to its release on January 22, the game's director Naoki Hamaguchi emphasizes the importance of maintaining high-quality graphics, particularly in lighting, to ensure that the Switch 2 version does not compromise on visual fidelity. This commitment to quality could set a new standard for how large-scale games are optimized for portable consoles. Will this push for quality over size influence future game development on the Switch 2 and beyond?
