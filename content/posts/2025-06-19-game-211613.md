NINES has just dropped an exciting announcement that puzzle game enthusiasts won't want to miss: their upcoming title, **Pipeworks Puzzle**. This game promises to breathe new life into the classic tile sliding puzzle genre, featuring charming visuals and soothing soundtracks that are sure to captivate players. The reveal, complete with a trailer shared across social media, showcases a game that blends creativity with strategic thinking.

In **Pipeworks Puzzle**, players step into the shoes of a plumber at a bustling construction site, tasked with arranging disordered pipe pieces to match a blueprint. The gameplay is set in a grid-based arena, where players can only move pieces in the cardinal directions—up, down, left, and right. Adding to the fun is a support character named ‘Boss’, designed by Twitch artist PokuriMio, who guides players from novice to master plumber. This character adds a layer of personality and charm to the game, making it not just a puzzle challenge, but a delightful journey.

Players can wishlist **Pipeworks Puzzle** now on Steam, with the promise of unlocking exciting features like an endless mode, speedrun challenges, and even multiplayer battles with friends. A demo is also on the horizon, so be sure to follow the game on Steam to stay updated. Will you be ready to tackle the pipes when the game launches later this year?
