Red Dead Redemption fans are buzzing with anticipation as Rob Wiethoff, the actor behind the iconic character John Marston, has hinted at some “exciting news” related to the franchise. During a recent livestream, Wiethoff teased that he has news to share before the end of the week, sparking speculation about a potential current-generation version of Red Dead Redemption 2 for the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2.

This revelation comes on the heels of Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick's comments about the Switch 2, where he expressed confidence in the platform's launch support. With titles like Civilization VI and Borderlands 4 already lined up, the addition of a beloved franchise like Red Dead Redemption could significantly boost the console's appeal. The gaming community is eager to see how this unfolds, especially given the enduring popularity of the Red Dead series.

As we await further announcements, the excitement around the potential for Red Dead Redemption on the Switch 2 raises questions about how the game will adapt to the new hardware and what features might be included. Will this be the revival that fans have been hoping for? Only time will tell.
