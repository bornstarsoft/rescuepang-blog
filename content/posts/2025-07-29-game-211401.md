In an exciting shift for the indie gaming scene, the development team formerly known as No Code has officially rebranded to Screen Burn. This change reflects their evolution as a studio, now incorporating coders into their creative process, and aims to better encapsulate the essence of their games, which often explore the nostalgic imperfections of older technology and the profound impact of storytelling.

Founded by Jon McKellan and Omar Khan in Glasgow, Scotland, Screen Burn has already made waves with titles like Stories Untold and Observation. As they gear up for their upcoming project, Silent Hill: Townfall, this name change signifies a fresh chapter in their journey, one that aligns with their growth and the innovative spirit they embody.

As the gaming industry continues to evolve, its fascinating to see how branding can play a crucial role in a studio's identity. What do you think about the importance of a name in the gaming world?
