Amazon Games has officially confirmed that its MMO, New World: Aeternum, will be shutting down permanently on January 31, 2027. This announcement comes after the game was pulled from storefronts, including Steam and the Xbox store, marking the end of an era for players who have invested time and resources into this virtual world. With no new content planned and the game delisted for purchase by January 15, 2026, the community is left to reflect on their experiences in Aeternum.

In a heartfelt message, Amazon Games expressed gratitude to its players for their dedication and passion, acknowledging the shared journey in crafting the world of New World. The decision follows significant layoffs within the company, impacting the development teams behind the game. As the final year approaches, players can still enjoy the extended Nighthaven season, but the looming shutdown raises questions about the future of MMO gaming and the impact of corporate decisions on beloved titles.

As we bid farewell to New World, its a poignant reminder of the transient nature of online gaming experiences. What will the future hold for players seeking new adventures in the ever-evolving landscape of MMOs?
