Amazon Prime Gaming has just sweetened the deal for subscribers by adding six more bonus games to its lineup, including the iconic *Tomb Raider I-III Remastered*. This exciting announcement comes just in time for Prime Day, allowing gamers to expand their libraries with some fantastic titles at no extra cost.

Starting today, June 17, at 9 AM PT, subscribers can claim these games directly from the Amazon Prime Gaming page. The selection includes *Dungeon of the Endless: Definitive Edition*, *Saints Row 2*, *Saints Row IV: Re-Elected*, *Star Wars: Rebellion*, *TOEM*, and the remastered *Tomb Raider* trilogy. What's particularly appealing is that once claimed, these games remain in your library even if you decide to cancel your Prime subscription later on.

This move by Amazon not only enhances the value of the Prime Gaming service but also highlights the growing competition in the gaming subscription space. With such a diverse range of titles, itâ€™s a great time for gamers to explore new genres and revisit classics. Are you ready to dive into these adventures?
