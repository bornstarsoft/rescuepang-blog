Enigmo, the beloved puzzle game originally launched in 2003, has made a triumphant return as a spatial 3D experience, now available exclusively for the Samsung Galaxy XR. This remake, developed by Fortell Games, invites players to engage in a unique challenge where they manipulate lasers, plasma, and water using nine different puzzle pieces to solve intricate puzzles throughout their own rooms.

With 50 base levels and two additional packs, Enigmo offers a rich gameplay experience that combines hand tracking and controller support. Players will encounter various mechanics such as teleporters and gravity inverters, making each level a fresh challenge. While currently a timed exclusive for the Galaxy XR, Fortell Games has plans to expand the game's reach to Meta Quest headsets, though a release date for that version remains unconfirmed.

As we embrace this new era of spatial gaming, Enigmo stands out as a testament to the evolution of puzzle games in virtual reality. Are you ready to dive into this immersive puzzle-solving adventure?
