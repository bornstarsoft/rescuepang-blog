In an inspiring display of community spirit, a charity quiz has successfully raised over 2 million for Marie Curie over the past 18 years. This annual event, organized by the charity's North West fundraising group, not only tests participants' knowledge but also brings together teams from various businesses and organizations to support a noble cause. The funds generated play a crucial role in providing care and support for individuals with terminal illnesses and their families.

Marie Curie is dedicated to offering nursing care, hospice support, and bereavement counseling, making a significant impact on the lives of those in need. The quiz has become a beloved tradition in the local community, showcasing how collective efforts can lead to remarkable achievements. As we reflect on this success, it raises an important question: how can we leverage similar community-driven initiatives to support other vital causes in our society?
