In an exciting turn of events for retro gaming enthusiasts, the long-lost NES puzzle game Xcavator, originally developed by Chris Oberth in 1991, is making a comeback. Thanks to a collaboration between iam8bit and the Video Game History Foundation, this unreleased gem will be available as a fully polished cartridge edition in 2025. Priced at $100, the release not only includes an authentic NES cartridge but also a detailed manual that dives into the game's troubled past and Oberth's career, shedding light on the broader challenges of preserving 8-bit history.

This revival is more than just a nostalgic trip down memory lane; it represents a significant effort to preserve gaming history. The profits from this release will support the Video Game History Foundation's archival efforts, ensuring that future generations can appreciate the rich tapestry of video game development. As we witness the resurgence of such titles, one can't help but wonder what other hidden treasures from the past are waiting to be discovered and shared with the world.
