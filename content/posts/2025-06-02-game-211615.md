In a significant turn of events, People Can Fly, the studio behind popular titles like Gears of War and Outriders, has announced the cancellation of two unannounced games due to ongoing disputes with their publisher, Square Enix. This decision not only halts the development of Project Gemini and Project Bifrost but also signals impending layoffs within the studio, affecting over 30 developers who were previously engaged in these projects.

CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski expressed deep regret over the situation, citing a lack of communication from Square Enix regarding the future of Project Gemini as a primary factor for its cancellation. The studio's financial analysis revealed insufficient cash flow to continue the production of Project Bifrost, leading to a necessary restructuring of their teams. This news comes on the heels of previous project cancellations, including the co-op action RPG Project Dagger, highlighting the challenges faced by game developers in an ever-evolving industry.

As People Can Fly navigates these turbulent waters, the future of their upcoming projects remains uncertain. With a legacy of delivering engaging gaming experiences, fans and industry watchers alike will be keenly observing how the studio adapts and what new directions they may take. Will they emerge stronger from this setback, or will it signal a more significant shift in their development strategy?
