Starting today, VGC is launching an exciting Patreon Christmas pledge drive aimed at expanding our festive content like never before! By contributing to [Patreon.com/VideoGamesChronicle](https://www.patreon.com/VideoGamesChronicle), you can help unlock some of our most-requested future videos, shows, and more. This initiative not only enhances the content we provide but also strengthens our vibrant gaming community.

Throughout December, every new, gifted, or upgraded membership will contribute points towards our overall goal. As we reach milestones, well unveil stretch goals that include deep dives into our magazine archives, special guest appearances, and even commentary tracks for classic video game movies. If we hit our highest target, well celebrate with a special announcement regarding the VGC Podcast!

The content unlocked during this drive will be shared throughout December and early January, ensuring your festive break is filled with VGC excitement. Join us in supporting independent games media and lets make this holiday season unforgettable! What special content are you hoping to see unlocked?
