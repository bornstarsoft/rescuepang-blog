This week, the highly anticipated launch of Tony Hawks Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be celebrated in a unique way at Shredenhams, an abandoned department store transformed into a skatepark. This free event promises to be a thrilling experience for both skaters and non-skaters alike, featuring family-friendly skate sessions where attendees can learn from professional skaters. 

On Saturday, July 12, fans will have the opportunity to collect SKATE letters around the park, echoing the in-game missions that made the original series a hit. Completing these tasks could lead to exciting prizes related to the game, making it a perfect day for both nostalgia and fun. As the sun sets, the event will transition into a launch party with a free skate session, highlighted by a performance from The 900, a tribute band dedicated to the iconic Tony Hawks Pro Skater soundtrack.

With the release of Tony Hawks Pro Skater 3 + 4 marking a return to the beloved series after five years, its a moment of celebration for fans. However, the decision to include only a handful of classic tracks in the new soundtrack has sparked discussions among the community. Will this event reignite the passion for skateboarding games and bring new players into the fold? Only time will tell!
