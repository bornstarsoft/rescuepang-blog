Nintendo Switch Online has just added three exciting titles to its SNES library, including the groundbreaking release of "Mario & Wario," marking its first official availability outside Japan. This addition not only expands the library to a total of 77 games in the West but also highlights Nintendo's commitment to preserving and sharing its rich gaming history.

"Mario & Wario," a unique puzzle platformer developed by Game Freak, challenges players to guide Mario through 100 levels while he is blinded by obstacles placed by Wario. This game, which originally required a Super Famicom Mouse, now utilizes the Switch's Joy-Cons for a fresh gameplay experience. Alongside this, fans can enjoy the quirky antics of "Bubsy in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind" and the enhanced fighting mechanics of "Fatal Fury Special."

As Nintendo continues to revive and reintroduce classic titles, one can't help but wonder what other hidden gems might make their way to the Switch Online platform. Are there any nostalgic games you hope to see next?
