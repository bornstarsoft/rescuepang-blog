In a startling revelation, November 2025 marked the worst month for hardware sales in the US in three decades, with just 1.6 million units sold. This decline, reported by market research firm Circana, reflects a staggering 27% drop in spending compared to the previous year, totaling $695 million. The average price for new gaming hardware reached an all-time high of $439, which likely contributed to the disappointing sales figures.

Traditionally, November is a peak month for gaming hardware sales, fueled by Black Friday promotions and holiday shopping. However, the combination of rising prices and a shift towards digital game purchases has significantly impacted physical game sales, which also saw a 14% decline this November. Notably, the PlayStation 5 emerged as the top-selling console, despite the overall downturn in the market.

As we look ahead, the question remains: how will console manufacturers adapt to these economic pressures? With tariffs and component costs rising, the outlook for hardware pricing seems bleak. Will we see a shift in strategy to attract consumers back to physical hardware?
