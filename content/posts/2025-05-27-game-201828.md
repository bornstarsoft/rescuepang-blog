In a bold move that has caught the attention of the gaming community, indie developer Pixel Maniacs has announced their upcoming title, **ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard**, claiming, "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did." This audacious statement sets high expectations for a game that aims to fill the void left by Valve's reluctance to produce a third installment in the beloved Portal series. With its unique color-based mechanics, ChromaGun 2 could offer a fresh take on puzzle-solving that resonates with fans of the genre.

The game features a first-person perspective where players utilize a special gun to manipulate objects by changing their colors. While the aesthetic and narrative elements may evoke memories of Portal's testing chambers, the gameplay mechanics draw more parallels to titles like Qube and Qube 2. This shift in focus from portals to color manipulation presents an intriguing evolution in puzzle design, promising to challenge players in new ways. A free demo is available on Steam, allowing eager gamers to experience the innovative mechanics firsthand.

ChromaGun 2 is a sequel to the original ChromaGun, which was released in 2016 and received 'Mostly Positive' reviews. With a solid foundation and a unique twist on the puzzle genre, this sequel could be a standout title in 2025. As we look forward to its release, one can't help but wonder: will ChromaGun 2 carve its own legacy in the world of puzzle games, or will it remain in the shadow of its predecessors?
