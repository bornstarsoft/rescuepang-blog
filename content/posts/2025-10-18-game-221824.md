Battlefield 6 is set to enhance player experience with significant tweaks to XP earning and gadget unlocking. In a recent community update, Battlefield Studios announced that players will see a 10% increase in XP gained from completing matches and a whopping 40% boost from daily bonuses. This means players can expect to unlock useful attachments almost twice as fast, addressing long-standing frustrations about the slow progression system.

In addition to XP adjustments, the studio is also revising the career rank requirements for certain assignments, which unlock cosmetic and gameplay content. Players will now access these assignments at lower ranks, making it easier to achieve milestones. The developers are aware of the community's concerns regarding the challenges and are actively working on improvements, aiming to create a smoother and more rewarding progression experience.

As Battlefield Studios continues to refine the game, they are also tackling issues related to Portal servers, which have been overwhelmed by XP farming activities. The goal is to strike a balance between efficient progression and engaging gameplay. With these updates on the horizon, players can look forward to a more fulfilling experience in Battlefield 6. What other changes would you like to see in the game?
