After two decades of anticipation, retro-gaming enthusiasts can finally rejoice as Incube8 Games announces the release of "Infinity" on the Game Boy Color, set for Q4 of 2025. This tactical RPG, originally developed by Affinix Software between 1999 and 2001, was a project that pushed the limits of the Game Boy Color before its unfortunate cancellation in 2002. With a unique strategic battle system and an engaging plot, Infinity promises to be a standout title for retro gamers and newcomers alike.

The games narrative revolves around an ancient evil threatening to plunge two rival nations into chaos, while players navigate a rich world filled with over 30 explorable areas and 5 playable characters. With its stunning 8-bit graphics and a plethora of items to discover, Infinity is not just a game; it's a nostalgic journey back to the golden age of handheld gaming. Pre-orders are now available, including a collector's edition packed with exclusive goodies.

As we look forward to the release, one can't help but wonder: will Infinity redefine the tactical RPG genre for a new generation of gamers? Only time will tell, but the excitement is palpable as we prepare for this long-awaited comeback in retro gaming history.
