In a significant turn of events, Rare is set to discuss the future of its popular game, Sea of Thieves, during its first-ever Community Direct. Scheduled for tomorrow at 3 PM UK / 10 AM ET, the broadcast promises insights into upcoming Seasons and major changes to the Insider Programme. This comes on the heels of widespread layoffs at Microsoft, which have left the gaming community concerned about the stability and direction of its beloved titles.

The recent layoffs at Microsoft, affecting around 9,100 employees, have raised eyebrows, especially with the cancellation of Rare's highly anticipated project, Everwild. Veteran developers, including Gregg Mayles and Louise OConnor, are departing the company, marking the end of an era for Rare. As the gaming landscape shifts, the fate of Sea of Thieves hangs in the balance, and fans are eager to see how Rare will navigate these turbulent waters.

As we look forward to the Community Direct, one can't help but wonder: how will these changes impact the future of Sea of Thieves and its dedicated community? Will Rare emerge stronger, or will the shadows of recent layoffs loom large over its future endeavors?
