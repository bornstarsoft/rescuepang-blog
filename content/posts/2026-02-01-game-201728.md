In the world of gaming, cozy games often evoke images of tranquil landscapes and gentle gameplay. However, some titles challenge this notion by offering unexpected twists that require players to think outside the box. This post explores three surprising cozy games on Steam that defy conventional expectations and invite players to engage with their mechanics in innovative ways.

First up is **Viewfinder**, an adventure puzzle game that allows players to reshape their environment through photography. By snapping pictures and placing them strategically in the world, you can create new pathways and solve intricate puzzles without the pressure of timers. This unique mechanic encourages exploration and creativity, making it a standout in the cozy gaming genre.

Next, we have **Gorogoa**, a beautifully crafted puzzle game that transforms the way you perceive art. With its hand-drawn illustrations and panel-based gameplay, players must rearrange and combine images to progress. This BAFTA-winning title not only captivates with its visuals but also challenges your cognitive skills in a relaxing yet engaging manner.

Lastly, **Superliminal** takes players on a mind-bending journey through a dream-like world where perspective is everything. While it incorporates elements of psychological horror, the game remains accessible and enjoyable, especially when played in co-op mode with friends. As you navigate through surreal landscapes, youll discover that changing your viewpoint can lead to unexpected solutions.
