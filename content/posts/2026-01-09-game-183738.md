Exciting news for gamers! Obsidian's action RPG, Avowed, is set to make its debut on PlayStation 5 next month, bringing a wealth of new content and features. Scheduled for release on February 17, the PS5 version will coincide with an anniversary update that introduces a New Game Plus mode, new races, new weapon types, and a Photo Mode, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.

Originally launched on Xbox consoles and PC, Avowed has been well-received for its engaging narrative and immersive world set in Eora, a universe first explored in the Pillars of Eternity series. The upcoming anniversary update promises to deliver a "more rounded experience," as described by Obsidian, making it a perfect time for new players to dive into this fantasy action RPG.

With this multi-platform strategy, Microsoft continues to broaden its reach, allowing more gamers to enjoy titles like Avowed. As the gaming landscape evolves, it will be interesting to see how Obsidian builds on this success in future releases. Are you ready to explore Eora on your PS5?
