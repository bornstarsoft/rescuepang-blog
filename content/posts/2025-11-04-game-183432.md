The gaming world is buzzing as Nintendo's Switch 2 has made a significant impact at the 43rd annual Golden Joystick Awards, with its launch titles, Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza, both nominated for the prestigious 'Console Game of the Year' award. This recognition highlights the innovative gameplay and engaging experiences that these titles bring to the table, setting a high bar for future releases on the platform.

In addition to their nominations for the top award, Mario Kart World is also vying for 'Best Multiplayer' and Donkey Kong Bananza is in the running for 'Best Audio Design'.
