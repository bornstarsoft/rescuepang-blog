The gaming world is buzzing with excitement as Netflix prepares to launch its new FIFA game, overseen by Julien Merceron, the former chief technology officer at Konami. This game aims to redefine the FIFA experience, especially with the upcoming 2026 World Cup in sight. With Merceron's rich background in developing the Fox Engine for iconic titles like Metal Gear Solid 5 and the Pro Evolution Soccer series, expectations are high for this reimagined football game.

Delphi Interactive, the studio behind this ambitious project, is committed to crafting a game that resonates with both new players and seasoned fans. Merceron emphasizes a return to the core principles that made football games enjoyable, focusing on fun and accessibility while ensuring depth for those who crave a more immersive experience. As the game will be available through a Netflix subscription, it could potentially reach a vast audience, changing how we think about sports gaming.

As we look forward to this innovative approach to the FIFA franchise, one can't help but wonder: will Netflix's entry into the gaming arena set a new standard for how we experience sports games in the future?
