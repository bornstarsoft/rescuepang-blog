In a bold move that has caught the attention of gamers worldwide, indie developer Pixel Maniacs has announced ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard, claiming it as the sequel to Portal 2 that Valve never made. This audacious comparison sets high expectations, especially considering the legacy of Portal 2 as one of the most celebrated puzzle games in history. With a free demo available on Steam, players can dive into this colorful world and see if it lives up to the hype.

While the game draws inspiration from the aesthetics and themes of Portal, the puzzle mechanics seem to echo more closely with titles like Qube and Qube 2. Players will utilize a unique gun to manipulate colors and solve challenges, steering away from the iconic portals that defined the original Portal series. This fresh take on puzzle-solving might just attract a new generation of gamers looking for innovative gameplay experiences.

ChromaGun 2 is not just a sequel; it represents the spirit of indie gamingâ€”bold, creative, and unafraid to challenge the status quo. As we look forward to its release, it raises an interesting question: Can indie developers fill the void left by major studios, and will ChromaGun 2 carve its own niche in the puzzle genre?
